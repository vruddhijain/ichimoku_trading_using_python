# ichimoku_trading_using_python

In my quest to develop a standout and customized algorithm for trade entry, I have chosen to implement the Ichimoku indicator. This decision was motivated by the indicator's versatility, clear trade signals, and its esteemed reputation among traders globally. The video I selected, "Ichimoku Cloud Trading Strategy Explained" by Kevin Cortese on YouTube [Link: https://youtu.be/IiAHKhnm2n4], provides comprehensive insights and practical applications of the Ichimoku indicator. In this note, I will elaborate on why I opted for this indicator, the relevance of the chosen video, and the innovative thought process employed to create a distinct trade entry recommendation algorithm.
